# skills Adapter

This adapter keeps Codex mostly stock and layers behavior via skills and scripts.

Current state:

- `happy-launch --mode skills` launches `happycode` and tags runtime with `HAPPY_INTEGRATION_MODE=skills`.
- Skills remain the primary composition unit for workflow behavior.

Run:

```bash
happy-launch --mode skills
```
